        /// * `should_include_writers`: Indicates whether the given set of VSS writers' UUIDs should be included or excluded from the application consistent recovery point. By default, the value is set to false, indicating that all listed VSS writers' UUIDs will be excluded.
        /// * `writers`: List of VSS writer UUIDs that are used in an application consistent recovery point. The default values are the system and the registry writer UUIDs.
        /// * `should_store_vss_metadata`: Indicates whether to store the VSS metadata if the user is interested in application-specific backup/restore. The VSS metadata consists of VSS writers and requester metadata details. These are compressed into a cabinet file(.cab file) during a VSS backup operation. This cabinet file must be saved to the backup media during a backup operation, as it is required during the restore operation.
