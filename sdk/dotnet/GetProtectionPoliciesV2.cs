The values must be between 00h:00m and 23h:59m and in UTC timezone. It specifies the time when the first snapshot is taken and replicated for any entity added to the policy. If this is not specified, the snapshot is taken immediately and replicated for any new entity added to the policy.

        /// 
        /// * `Local`: - Specifies the auto rollup retention details.
        /// * `Remote`: - Specifies the auto rollup retention details.

        /// The local, remote attribute in the AutoRollupRetention supports the following:
        /// 
        /// * `SnapshotIntervalType`: - Snapshot interval period.
        ///    * `YEARLY`: Specifies the number of latest yearly recovery points to retain.
        ///    * `WEEKLY`: Specifies the number of latest weekly recovery points to retain.
        ///    * `DAILY`: Specifies the number of latest daily recovery points to retain.
        ///    * `MONTHLY`: Specifies the number of latest monthly recovery points to retain.
        ///    * `HOURLY`: Specifies the number of latest hourly recovery points to retain.
        /// * `Frequency`: - Multiplier to 'snapshotIntervalType'. For example, if 'snapshotIntervalType' is 'YEARLY' and 'multiple' is 5, then 5 years worth of rollup snapshots will be retained.
