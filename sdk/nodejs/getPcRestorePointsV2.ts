 * The list restore points API allows you to retrieve a list of available restore points, which are snapshots of the domain manager taken at different times. These restore points can be used to revert the domain manager to a previous state. The list response includes the creation time and identifier ID for the configuration data.
 *
 * - For cluster-based backups, only the most recent restore point is available, as backups are continuous.
 * - For object store-based backups, multiple restore points may be available, depending on the configured Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and the retention period set on the s3 bucket.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as nutanix from "@pierskarsenbarg/nutanix";
 * import * as nutanix from "@pulumi/nutanix";
 *
 * const pe = new nutanix.Provider("pe", {
