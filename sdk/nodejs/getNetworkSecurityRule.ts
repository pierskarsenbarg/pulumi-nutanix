 * Describes a Network security rule

 * > NOTE: The use of networkSecurityRule is only applicable in AHV clusters and requires Microsegmentation to be enabled. This feature is a function of the Flow product and requires a Flow license.

 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Isolate Development VMs From Production VMs And Get Its Information)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as nutanix from "@pulumi/nutanix";
 *
 * const isolation = new nutanix.NetworkSecurityRule("isolation", {
 *     description: "Isolation Rule Example",
 *     isolationRuleAction: "APPLY",
 *     isolationRuleFirstEntityFilterKindLists: ["vm"],
 *     isolationRuleFirstEntityFilterParams: [{
 *         name: "Environment",
 *         values: ["Dev"],
 *     }],
 *     isolationRuleFirstEntityFilterType: "CATEGORIES_MATCH_ALL",
 *     isolationRuleSecondEntityFilterKindLists: ["vm"],
 *     isolationRuleSecondEntityFilterParams: [{
 *         name: "Environment",
 *         values: ["Production"],
 *     }],
 *     isolationRuleSecondEntityFilterType: "CATEGORIES_MATCH_ALL",
 * });
 * const test = isolation.id.apply(id => nutanix.getNetworkSecurityRule({
