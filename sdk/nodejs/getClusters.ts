/**
 * Describes Clusters
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as nutanix from "@pulumi/nutanix";
 *
 * const clusters = pulumi.output(nutanix.getClusters());
 * ```
 * ## Reference
 *
 * The `projectReference`, `ownerReference`, `availabilityZoneReference`, `clusterReference`, attributes supports the following:
 *
 * * `kind`: - The kind name (Default value: project).
 * * `name`: - the name.
 * * `UUID`: - the UUID.
 *
 * ### Version
 *
 * The version attribute supports the following:
 *
 * * `productName`: - Name of the producer/distribution of the image. For example windows or red hat.
 * * `productVersion`: - Version string for the disk image.
 *
 * See detailed information in [Nutanix Image](https://nutanix.github.io/Automation/experimental/swagger-redoc-sandbox/#tag/clusters/paths/~1clusters~1multicluster_config/post).

     * * `sslKeyExpireDatetime`: - UTC date and time in RFC-3339 format when the key expires
     * * `serviceList`: - Array of enabled cluster services. For example, a cluster can function as both AOS and cloud data gateway. - 'AOS': Regular Prism Element - 'PRISM_CENTRAL': Prism Central - 'CLOUD_DATA_GATEWAY': Cloud backup and DR gateway - 'AFS': Cluster for file server - 'WITNESS' : Witness cluster - 'XI_PORTAL': Xi cluster.
     * * `supportedInformationVerbosity`: - Verbosity level settings for populating support information. - 'Nothing': Send nothing - 'Basic': Send basic information - skip core dump and hypervisor stats information - 'BasicPlusCoreDump': Send basic and core dump information - 'All': Send all information (Default value: BASIC_PLUS_CORE_DUMP)
     * * `certificationSigningInfo`: - Customer information used in Certificate Signing Request for creating digital certificates.
     * * `operationMode`: - Cluster operation mode. - 'NORMAL': Cluster is operating normally. - 'READ_ONLY': Cluster is operating in read only mode. - 'STAND_ALONE': Only one node is operational in the cluster. This is valid only for single node or two node clusters. - 'SWITCH_TO_TWO_NODE': Cluster is moving from single node to two node cluster. - 'OVERRIDE': Valid only for single node cluster. If the user wants to run vms on a single node cluster in read only mode, he can set the cluster peration mode to override. Writes will be allowed in override mode.

     * * `enabledFeatureList`: - Array of enabled features.
     * * `isAvailable`: - Indicates if cluster is available to contact. (Readonly)

     * * `externalDataServicesIp`: - The cluster IP address that provides external entities access to various cluster data services.
     * * `internalSubnet`: - The internal subnet is local to every server - its not visible outside.iSCSI requests generated internally within the appliance (by user VMs or VMFS) are sent to the internal subnet. The format is IP/netmask.
     * * `domainServerNameserver`: -  The IP of the nameserver that can resolve the domain name. Must set when joining the domain.
     * * `domainServerName`: - Joined domain name. In 'put' request, empty name will unjoin the cluster from current domain.
     * * `domainServerCredentials`: - Cluster domain credentials.
     * * `nfsSubnetWhitelist`: - Comma separated list of subnets (of the form 'a.b.c.d/l.m.n.o') that are allowed to send NFS requests to this container. If not specified, the global NFS whitelist will be looked up for access permission. The internal subnet is always automatically considered part of the whitelist, even if the field below does not explicitly specify it. Similarly, all the hypervisor IPs are considered part of the whitelist. Finally, to permit debugging, all of the SVMs local IPs are considered to be implicitly part of the whitelist.
     * * `nameServerIpList`: - The list of IP addresses of the name servers.
