/**
 * List Templates with details like name, description, VM configuration, etc. This operation supports filtering, sorting & pagination.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as nutanix from "@pierskarsenbarg/nutanix";
 *
 * const list_templates = nutanix.getTemplatesV2({});
 * const filtered_templates = nutanix.getTemplatesV2({
 *     filter: "startswith(templateName,'template_name')",
 *     limit: 10,
 *     page: 1,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Templates
 *
 * The `templates` object is a list of all templates. Each template has the following attributes:
 *
 * * `tenantId` - A globally unique identifier that represents the tenant that owns this entity. The system automatically assigns it, and it and is immutable from an API consumer perspective (some use cases may cause this Id to change - For instance, a use case may require the transfer of ownership of the entity, but these cases are handled automatically on the server).
 * * `links`: A HATEOAS style link for the response. Each link contains a user-friendly name identifying the link and an address for retrieving the particular resource.
 * * `extId`: A globally unique identifier of an instance that is suitable for external consumption.
 * * `templateName`: The user defined name of a Template.
 * * `templateDescription`: The user defined description of a Template.
 * * `templateVersionSpec`: A model that represents an object instance that is accessible through an API endpoint. Instances of this type get an extId field that contains the globally unique identifier for that instance
 * * `guestUpdateStatus`: Status of a Guest Update.
 * * `createTime`: Time when the Template was created.
 * * `updateTime`: Time when the Template was last updated.
 * * `createdBy`: Information of the User.
 * * `updatedBy`: Information of the User.

 * ### Links
 * The `links` attribute supports the following:
 *
 * * `href`: - The URL at which the entity described by the link can be accessed.
