/**
 * Returns a list of elements representing the domain manager (Prism Central) instance.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as nutanix from "@pierskarsenbarg/nutanix";
 *
 * const pcs = nutanix.getPcsV2({});
 * const pcs_select = nutanix.getPcsV2({
 *     select: "config,extId",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## PCS
 *
 * The `pcs` argument supports the following:
 *
 * * `tenantId`: - A globally unique identifier that represents the tenant that owns this entity. The system automatically assigns it, and it and is immutable from an API consumer perspective (some use cases may cause this Id to change - For instance, a use case may require the transfer of ownership of the entity, but these cases are handled automatically on the server).
 * * `extId`: - A globally unique identifier of an instance that is suitable for external consumption.
 * * `links`: - A HATEOAS style link for the response. Each link contains a user-friendly name identifying the link and an address for retrieving the particular resource.
 * * `config`: - Domain manager (Prism Central) cluster configuration details.
 * * `isRegisteredWithHostingCluster`: - Boolean value indicating if the domain manager (Prism Central) is registered with the hosting cluster, that is, Prism Element.
 * * `network`: - Domain manager (Prism Central) network configuration details.
 * * `hostingClusterExtId`: - The external identifier of the cluster hosting the domain manager (Prism Central) instance.
 * * `shouldEnableHighAvailability`: - This configuration enables Prism Central to be deployed in scale-out mode.
 * * `nodeExtIds`: - Domain manager (Prism Central) nodes external identifier.
 *
 * ### Config
 * The config argument supports the following:
 *
 * * `shouldEnableLockdownMode`: - A boolean value indicating whether to enable lockdown mode for a cluster.
 * * `buildInfo`: -Currently representing the build information to be used for the cluster creation.
 * * `name`: - Name of the domain manager (Prism Central).
 * * `size`: - Domain manager (Prism Central) size is an enumeration of starter, small, large, or extra large starter values. possible values are:
 *   * `SMALL` : Domain manager (Prism Central) of size small.
 *   * `LARGE` : Domain manager (Prism Central) of size large.
 *   * `EXTRALARGE` : Domain manager (Prism Central) of size extra large.
 *   * `STARTER` : Domain manager (Prism Central) of size starter.
 * * `bootstrapConfig`: - Bootstrap configuration details for the domain manager (Prism Central).
 * * `resourceConfig`: - This configuration is used to provide the resource-related details like container external identifiers, number of VCPUs, memory size, data disk size of the domain manager (Prism Central). In the case of a multi-node setup, the sum of resources like number of VCPUs, memory size and data disk size are provided.
