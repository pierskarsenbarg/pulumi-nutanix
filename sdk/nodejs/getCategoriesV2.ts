/**
 * List categories
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as nutanix from "@pulumi/nutanix";
 *
 * const categories_list = nutanix.getCategoriesV2({});
 * const categories_paginated = nutanix.getCategoriesV2({
 *     page: 1,
 *     limit: 10,
 * });
 * const categories_sorted = nutanix.getCategoriesV2({
 *     orderBy: "key desc",
 * });
 * const categories_filtered = nutanix.getCategoriesV2({
 *     filter: "key eq 'key_example'",
 * });
 * export const category = categories_list.then(categories_list => categories_list.categories?.[0]);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Categories
 *
 * The `categories` contains list of categories. Each category has the following attributes:
 *
 * * `extId`: The extID for the category.
 * * `key`: The key of a category when it is represented in key:value format.
 * * `value`: The value of a category when it is represented in key:value format
 * * `type`: Denotes the type of a category.
 *   There are three types of categories: SYSTEM, INTERNAL, and USER.
 * * `description`: A string consisting of the description of the category as defined by the user.
 * * `ownerUuid`: This field contains the UUID of a user who owns the category.
 * * `associations`: This field gives basic information about resources that are associated to the category.
 * * `detailedAssociations`: This field gives detailed information about resources that are associated to the category.
 * * `tenantId`: A globally unique identifier that represents the tenant that owns this entity.
 * * `links`: A HATEOAS style link for the response. Each link contains a user-friendly name identifying the link and an address for retrieving the particular resource.
 *
 * ### associations
 * * `categoryId`: External identifier for the given category, used across all v4 apis/entities/resources where categories are referenced.
 * * `resourceType`: An enum denoting the associated resource types. Resource types are further grouped into 2 types - entity or a policy.
 * * `resourceGroup`: An enum denoting the resource group.
 *   Resources can be organized into either an entity or a policy.
 * * `count`: Count of associations of a particular type of entity or policy
 *
 * ### detailedAssociations
 * * `categoryId`: External identifier for the given category, used across all v4 apis/entities/resources where categories are referenced.
 * * `resourceType`: An enum denoting the associated resource types. Resource types are further grouped into 2 types - entity or a policy.
 * * `resourceGroup`: An enum denoting the resource group.
 *   Resources can be organized into either an entity or a policy.
 * * `resourceId`: The UUID of the entity or policy associated with the particular category.
 *
 * See detailed information in [Nutanix List Categories v4](https://developers.nutanix.com/api-reference?namespace=prism&version=v4.0#tag/Categories/operation/listCategories).
