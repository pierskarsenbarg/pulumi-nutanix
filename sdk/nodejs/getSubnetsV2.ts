 * Get the list of existing subnets.
 *
 * ## Subnets
 *
 * The `subnets` object contains the following attributes:
 *
 * - `extId`: A globally unique identifier of an instance that is suitable for external consumption.
 * - `name`: Name of the subnet.
 * - `description`: Description of the subnet.
 * - `subnetType`: Type of subnet.
 * - `networkId`: or VLAN subnet, this field represents VLAN Id, valid range is from 0 to 4095; For overlay subnet, this field represents 24-bit VNI, this field is read-only.
 * - `dhcpOptions`: List of DHCP options to be configured.
 * - `ipConfig`: IP configuration for the subnet.
 * - `clusterReference`: UUID of the cluster this subnet belongs to.
 * - `virtualSwitchReference`: UUID of the virtual switch this subnet belongs to (type VLAN only).
 * - `vpcReference`: UUID of Virtual Private Cloud this subnet belongs to (type Overlay only).
 * - `isNatEnabled`: Indicates whether NAT must be enabled for VPCs attached to the subnet. This is supported only for external subnets. NAT is enabled by default on external subnets.
 * - `isExternal`: Indicates whether the subnet is used for external connectivity.
 * - `reservedIpAddresses`: List of IPs that are excluded while allocating IP addresses to VM ports.
 * - `dynamicIpAddresses`: List of IPs, which are a subset from the reserved IP address list, that must be advertised to the SDN gateway.
 * - `networkFunctionChainReference`: UUID of the Network function chain entity that this subnet belongs to (type VLAN only).
 * - `bridgeName`: Name of the bridge on the host for the subnet.
 * - `isAdvancedNetworking`: Indicates whether the subnet is used for advanced networking.
 * - `clusterName`: Cluster Name
 * - `hypervisorType`: Hypervisor Type
 * - `virtualSwitch`: Schema to configure a virtual switch
 * - `vpc`: Networking common base object
 * - `ipPrefix`: IP Prefix in CIDR format.
 * - `ipUsage`: IP usage statistics.
 * - `migrationState`: Migration state of the subnet. This field is read-only.
 * - `links`: A HATEOAS style link for the response. Each link contains a user-friendly name identifying the link and an address for retrieving the particular resource.
 *
 * ### dhcpOptions
 *
 * - `domainNameServers`: List of Domain Name Server addresses.
 * - `domainName`: The DNS domain name of the client.
 * - `searchDomains`: The DNS domain search list.
 * - `tftpServerName`: TFTP server name
 * - `bootFileName`: Boot file name
 * - `ntpServers`: List of NTP server addresses
 *
 * ### domain_name_servers, ntpServers
 *
 * - `ipv4`: IPv4 Object
 * - `ipv6`: IPv6 Object
 *
 * ### ipConfig
 *
 * - `ipv4`: IP V4 configuration.

 *
 * ### ip_config.ipv4, ip_config.ipv6
 *
 * - `ipSubnet`: subnet ip
 * - `defaultGatewayIp`: Reference to address configuration
 * - `dhcpServerAddress`: Reference to address configuration
 * - `poolList`: Pool of IP addresses from where IPs are allocated.
 *
 * ### ipSubnet
 *
 * - `ip`: Reference to address configuration
 * - `prefixLength`: The prefix length of the network to which this host IPv4 address belongs.
 *
 * ### poolList
 *
 * - `startIp`: Reference to address configuration
 * - `endIp`: Reference to address configuration
 *
 * ### ipUsage
 *
 * - `numMacs`: Number of MAC addresses.
 * - `numFreeIps`: Number of free IPs.
 * - `numAssignedIps`: Number of assigned IPs.
 * - `ipPoolUsages`: IP Pool usages
 *
 * ### ipPoolUsages
 *
 * - `numFreeIps`: Number of free IPs
 * - `numTotalIps`: Total number of IPs in this pool.
 * - `range`: Start/end IP address range.
 *
 * ### ipv4, ipv6 (Reference to address configuration)
 *
 * - `value`: value of address
 * - `prefixLength`: The prefix length of the network to which this host IPv4/IPv6 address belongs.
 *
